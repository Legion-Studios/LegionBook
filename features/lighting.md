# Lighting (Headlamps)

## 1. Usage

To use a flashlight, equip a piece of gear that has a built in flashlight. If you're using ACE, the ACE Arsenal will show the available light modes for gear with flashlights. Helmets, facewear, uniforms, and vests are all able to have flashlights equipped.

Once you have a compatible piece of gear equipped, you can turn on its flashlight in one of two ways. To disable the light, simply repeat one of the steps.

1. Using the keybind, which will grab the first piece of gear found, going in order of helmet; nvgs; facewear; uniform; vest.
2. Using the CBA context (double click) action on whatever piece of gear in your inventory.

### 1.1 Changing light mode

Most flashlights will also have separate "light modes". This can be any number of things, but the most common differences are the brightness and/or color of the light(s).

To change the light mode of the current gear, use the "Cycle Mode" keybind, which will change the mode of your current flashlight.
