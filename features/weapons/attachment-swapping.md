# Attachment Swapping

Weapons can be configured to automatically equip specific attachments when loading a certain kind of magazine. This is used on modular weapons like the DC-17M and its many configurations.

For example, when loading the standard DC-17M magazine, the blaster attachment will automatically equip. When loading the sniper magazine, the sniper attachment will automatically equip.
